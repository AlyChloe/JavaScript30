    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    //const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    const team = players.slice() // ****** this creates a copy
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players]

    const team4 = Array.from(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    var person = {
      name: 'Chloe',
      age: 27
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    person2.gender = 'female';
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99})
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person4 = {...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
